[blinky](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/samples/basic/blinky): a standard Zephyr basic example that blinks an LED forever using the Zephyr GPIO API by configuring a pin as output and toggling it in a loop. 

[threads](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/samples/basic/threads): a standard Zephyr basic example that spawns multiple compile-time threads that blink LEDs with different periods and report status via a FIFO to a print thread.

For more information about each example, please see the official Zephyr repository.
